# snail-algo

A friend of mine just had an interview for a job at Amazon... and he had a funny algorithm to work on. 
Something that I would describe as a 'snail algorithm' for a matrix.

So, I was wondering how to implement this .. and I wrote this in SCALA.. seems to work - although not entirely tested ;-)
